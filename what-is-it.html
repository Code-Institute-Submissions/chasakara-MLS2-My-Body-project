			<h2>Body Mass Index (BMI)</h2><br>
		    	Is a simple, inexpensive, and noninvasive surrogate measure of body fat. In
			    contrast to other methods, BMI relies solely on height and weight and with access to the
		    	proper equipment, individuals can have their BMI routinely measured and calculated
		    	with reasonable accuracy.<br>
			    Furthermore, studies have shown that BMI levels correlate with body fat and with future
			    health risks. High BMI predicts future morbidity and death. Therefore, BMI is an
			    appropriate measure for screening for obesity and its health risks.
			    Lastly, the widespread and longstanding application of BMI contributes to its utility at the
			    population level. Its use has resulted in an increased availability of published population
			    data that allows public health professionals to make comparisons across time, regions,
			    and population subgroups.<br><br>

			    If your BMI is below 18.5: Your BMI is considered underweight. Keep in mind that an underweight BMI
				calculation may pose certain health risks. Please consult with your healthcare
				provider for more information about BMI calculations.<br><br>

		        If your BMI is between 18.5-24.9: Your BMI is considered normal. This healthy weight helps reduce your risk 
                of serious health conditions and means you’re close to your fitness goals.<br><br>

		        If your BMI is between 25-29.9: Your BMI is considered overweight. Being overweight may increase your risk of 
                cardiovascular disease. Consult with your healthcare provider and consider making lifestyle changes through 
                healthy eating and fitness to improve your health.<br><br>

		        If your BMI is above 30: Your BMI is considered obese. People with obesity are at increased risk for many diseases 
                and health conditions, including cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure (Hypertension), Type 2 diabetes, 
                breathing problems and more. Consult with your healthcare provider and consider making lifestyle changes through healthy eating and fitness
		        to improve your overall health and quality of life.<br><br>
			
				<h3> Then, why does BMI matter?</h3>
				In general, the higher your BMI, the higher the risk of developing a range of conditions linked with
				excess weight, including:
                <ul>
				<li> diabetes</li>
				<li> arthritis</li>
				<li> liver disease</li>
				<li> several types of cancer (such as those of the breast, colon, and prostate)</li>
				<li> high blood pressure (hypertension)</li>
				<li> high cholesterol,</li>
				<li>sleep apnea.</li>
                 </ul>

				Current estimates suggest that up to 365,000 excess deaths due to obesity occur each year in the U.S. In
				addition, independent of any particular disease, people with high BMIs often report feeling better, both
				physically and psychologically, once they lose excess weight.
				And here’s why BMI may not matter
				It’s important to recognize that BMI itself is not measuring “health” or a physiological state (such as
				resting blood pressure) that indicates the presence (or absence) of disease. It is simply a measure of
				your size. Plenty of people have a high or low BMI and are healthy and, conversely, plenty of folks with
				a normal BMI are unhealthy. In fact, a person with a normal BMI who smokes and has a strong family
				history of cardiovascular disease may have a higher riskof early cardiovascular death than someone who
				has a high BMI but is a physically fit non-smoker.
				And then there is the “obesity paradox.” Some studies have found that despite the fact that the risk of
				certain diseases increases with rising BMI, people actually tend to live longer, on average, if their
				BMI is a bit on the higher side.
				Should we stop giving so much “weight” to BMI?
				That’s exactly what’s being asked in the discussion generated by a new study. For this study,
				researchers looked at how good the BMI was as a single measure of cardiovascular health and found that
				it wasn’t very good at all:
				* Nearly half of those considered overweight by BMI had a healthy “cardiometabolic profile,” including a
				normal blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar.
				* About a third of people with normal BMI measures had an unhealthy cardiometabolic profile.
				The authors bemoaned the “inaccuracy” of the BMI. They claim it translates into mislabeling millions of
				people as unhealthy and also overlooking millions of others who are actually unhealthy, but are
				considered “healthy” by BMI alone.
				Actually, this should come as no surprise. BMI, as a single measure, would not be expected to identify
				cardiovascular health or illness; the same is true for cholesterol, blood sugar, or blood pressure as a
				single measure. And while cardiovascular health is important, it’s not the only measure of health! For
				example, this study did not consider conditions that might also be relevant to an individual with an
				elevated BMI, such as liver disease or arthritis.
				Bottom line
				As a single measure, BMI is clearly not a perfect measure of health. But it’s still a useful starting
				point for important conditions that become more likely when a person is overweight or obese. In my view,
				it’s a good idea to know your BMI. But it’s also important to recognize its limitations.
